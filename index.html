    <h2>here will be a list of good recipies containing anything banana</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-creamy-ice-cream-with-just-one-ingredient-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-93414">one ingrediant ice cream</a></p>
    <p>One of the most ingenious things you can do with bananas is freeze them and then whirl them into a creamy, totally dairy-free "ice cream." If you're up for adding a second or third ingredient, try cocoa powder, toasted nuts, chocolate chucks, or even swirls of jam. Or just Nutella, duh.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-4-ingredient-banana-oat-bars-156571">4-Ingredient Banana Oat Bars</a></p>
    <p>This recipe is popular with parents avoiding dairy and eggs for allergy reasons, but it should be even more broadly known. It's so easy: just bananas, oats, dates, and nuts. They're chewy, satisfying, and a power-packed snack.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/banana-pudding-recipe-23636242">Banana Pudding</a></p>
    <p>This Southern dessert is a favorite for good reason: It's rich, creamy, and packed with buttery bites of vanilla wafers. Make it in one big serving dish or divide it among individual glasses or jars.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-one-bowl-banana-upside-down-cake-243998">One-Bowl Banana Upside-Down Cake</a></p>
    <p>Consider this your best step-up from basic banana bread: an easy cake that is nevertheless really impressive. This one-bowl cake is so simple, it hardly requires any foresight to bake it. That means it's the perfect thing to throw together when an afternoon sweet tooth hits.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-4-ingredient-chocolate-banana-coconut-cookies-247386">4-Ingredient Chocolate Banana Coconut Cookies</a></p>
    <p>Yes, these cookies really do only call for four ingredients, all of which you very well already have on hand. In fact, you can even skip the chocolate dip and drizzle, if you like â€” then the cookies only require two ingredients.</p>

     <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-2-ingredient-banana-pancakes-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-218658">2-Ingredient Banana Pancakes</a></p>
    <p>Like the banana ice cream, bananas make a magic trick here with these pancakes. If you haven't tried them yet, there's no better time than now. Combine a mashed banana with two eggs and you have a gluten-free, dairy-free pancake batter that will truly surprise you. They're almost custard-like, with a melt-in-your-mouth texture.</p>

     <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/chocolate-banana-cake-266705">Chocolate Banana Cake</a></p>
    <p>Want to really upgrade those bananas? Chocolate and peanut butter with this salted, creamy frosting are where it's at. This recipe calls for a whopping two cups of mashed bananas, from four to five bananas. That makes it the perfect solution for when you really do have more browned bunches than you know what to do with.</p>

     <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/easy-banana-kiwi-smoothie-255484">Banana Kiwi Smoothie</a></p>
    <p>Oh yeah, smoothies! Remember them? I feel like I often forget about them. You don't have to bake, especially as the weather warms up. Throw those ripe bananas in a box in the freezer and then make this bright, satisfying smoothie.</p>

     <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-roasted-peanut-butter-banana-breakfast-pops-246282">Peanut Butter Banana Breakfast Pops</a></p>
    <p>Want a break from muffins and smoothies? These breakfast pops do a smart thing with ripe bananas: Roast them for a darker flavor that stands up to peanut butter in these otherwise utterly simple Popsicles. Breakfast on a stick!</p>

     <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-blueberry-banana-cake-w-119567">Blueberry Banana Cake</a></p>
    <p>This is an old favorite: a really easy, really delicious and deeply luscious cake baked in a 9x13-inch pan and topped with a thick layer of simple cream cheese frosting. It's everything you want a blueberry muffin to be (but better).</p>
