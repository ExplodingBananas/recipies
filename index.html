    <h2>here will be a list of good recipies containing anything banana</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-creamy-ice-cream-with-just-one-ingredient-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-93414">one ingrediant ice cream</a></p>
    <p>One of the most ingenious things you can do with bananas is freeze them and then whirl them into a creamy, totally dairy-free "ice cream." If you're up for adding a second or third ingredient, try cocoa powder, toasted nuts, chocolate chucks, or even swirls of jam. Or just Nutella, duh.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-4-ingredient-banana-oat-bars-156571">4-Ingredient Banana Oat Bars</a></p>
    <p>This recipe is popular with parents avoiding dairy and eggs for allergy reasons, but it should be even more broadly known. It's so easy: just bananas, oats, dates, and nuts. They're chewy, satisfying, and a power-packed snack.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/banana-pudding-recipe-23636242">Banana Pudding</a></p>
    <p>This Southern dessert is a favorite for good reason: It's rich, creamy, and packed with buttery bites of vanilla wafers. Make it in one big serving dish or divide it among individual glasses or jars.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-one-bowl-banana-upside-down-cake-243998">One-Bowl Banana Upside-Down Cake</a></p>
    <p>Consider this your best step-up from basic banana bread: an easy cake that is nevertheless really impressive. This one-bowl cake is so simple, it hardly requires any foresight to bake it. That means it's the perfect thing to throw together when an afternoon sweet tooth hits.</p>
